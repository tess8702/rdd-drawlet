   <h1>You Draw It</h1>
   <h2>How Maximum Class Size Rules Affect Class Sizes and Earnings</h2>
   <p>Most schools in US follow the maximum class size rules. Let's say no more than 30 students in a class. A school with an enrollment of 10 is most likely to have 1 class. In some situations, it could be 2 classes, 5 students in each. How would a school decide the classroom size when there is 10, 20, 30, 40, 70, or even more student enrollment? Try to make the decisions for schools using the "You Draw It" applet.</p>
   <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <p>Click to add the point of the school enrollment and classroom size you estimate. Move the mouse to connect the points with a line. When you are done, double click to stop.</p>
   <p class='sr-only' aria-live='assertive'>It is a canvas defined by x and y axis. The size of school enrollment is on the x axis, ranging from 0 to 120; and the size of a classroom on the y axis, from 0 to 35. There is a verticl line at school enrollment equals 30,60,90, and 120, repectively. Therefore, the canvas has four panels, school enrollment 0-30, school enrollment 30-60, school enrollment 60-90, and school enrollment 90-120. There are three buttons below the canvas, which would enable users to clear the drawing or to start over, and submit the answer when it is done.</p>
